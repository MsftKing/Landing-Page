## Introduction

For this project, you'll create a complete web page based on a provided design. This assignment will challenge your skills and creativity as you work to replicate the design as closely as possible. The design is provided in two images: one showing the full website layout, and the other detailing the fonts and colors used.

## Project Guidelines

### Skills and Resources
- **Use Google:** Don’t hesitate to search for solutions or revisit previous lessons.
- **Approximate Accuracy:** Aim to get your project close to the design, but it doesn’t need to be pixel-perfect.
- **Content Flexibility:** Feel free to substitute your own content, images, and even adjust colors and fonts.

### Images and Legal Considerations
- **Use Free Images:** Ensure any images you use are free for use. Sites like Pexels, Pixabay, and Unsplash are great resources.
- **Credit Creators:** Credit the image creators in your project. A good place for this is in the README file.

## Setting Up Your Project

### GitHub Repository
1. **Initialize a Git Repository:** Create a new repository on GitHub.
2. **Commit Regularly:** Make sure to commit your changes early and often.

### Important Notes
- **Avoid Looking at Completed Solutions:** Don’t look at others’ solutions before completing your own. This helps you develop your problem-solving skills.
- **Seek Help When Needed:** Use the Discord server for help, but avoid looking at completed projects.

## Assignment Instructions

### Workflow
1. **Download the Design Images:** 
   - [Image One (Full Design)](path/to/full-design)
   - [Image Two (Color and Fonts)](path/to/color-fonts)
   
2. **Plan Your Approach:** Break down the project into manageable sections.
3. **HTML First, Then CSS:** 
   - Add all content to the page first.
   - Style the content afterward. One CSS file is sufficient.
4. **Focus on Desktop Layout:** Mobile optimization will be covered later.
